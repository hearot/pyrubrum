## Pyrubrum

```python
from pyrogram import Client
from pyrubrum import Handler, Menu, transform

bot = Client(...)

handler = Handler(transform(
    {
        Menu("Start", "start", "Hello!", default=True): [
            Menu("About me", "about_me", "I'm just a bot!"),
            Menu("Thoughts", "thoughts",
                 "I'm a bot, I cannot think properly..."),
        ]
    }
))

handler.setup(bot)
bot.run()
```
